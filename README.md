# 6. There are two major things to remember on git: local branch and remote branch
# 7. Changes from you local will be pushed to remote branch
# 8. In the same way we have to pull the latest remote branch changes to your local
# 9. Also, all devs will not work under same branch so we always have to pull in their changes as well.
