# 7. Changes from you local will be pushed to remote branch
# 8. In the same way we have to pull the latest remote branch changes to your local
# 9. Also, all devs will not work under same branch so we always have to pull in their changes as well.

# 10: Common git command: 
# 1. git add . (It will try to stage the changes to add to remote repo)

# 11: Coding standards and naming convention
# 1. should be a single name and should be lower-case
# 2. when declaring a class always first letter should be capital, then rest should follow camel casing 
# 3. Variables should always start with lowercase and follow camel case for the rest.
# 4. Variable name should away represent what the variable is representing. 
# 5. Method name should always start with smaller case and should be followed by camel casing.
# 6. Method name should describe what that method is performing.
